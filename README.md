## Python implementation of "Defending against adversarial attacks by randomized diversification"

A multi-channel architecture with a randomized diversification is a defense strategy against the adversarial attacks in a gray-box scenario. The gray-box attacks assume that the architecture of the classifier, defense mechanism and the training data set are known to the attacker. The attacker does not only have an access to a secret key and to the internal states of the system at the test time. 

### Train


### Test

The adversarial examples were generate by the attack propodsed by 
> Carlini Nicholas and Wagner David:  
> [Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04644.pdf) 

The corresponding python implementation was taken from https://github.com/carlini/nn_robust_attacks
